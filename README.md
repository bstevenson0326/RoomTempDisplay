# Room Temperature Display

A simple and customizable Rimworld mod that displays room temperatures directly on the map for quick reference. Supports color-coded temperature ranges and integrates with the vanilla heat overlay for a seamless UI experience.

## Features

- 🏠 Displays the temperature of each fully enclosed, roofed room.
- 🔴 Color-coded labels for cold, comfortable, and hot ranges (customizable).
- 🔁 Auto-updates with changes to room structure or temperature.
- 🔧 Toggleable overlay via a UI button in the lower right corner.
- 🧊 Integrates with the vanilla heat map overlay:
  - Small label in the upper wall corner (when overlay is off)
  - Large centered label in the middle of each room (when overlay is on)

## Settings

Accessible in the mod settings menu:
- **Show temperature range colors** – toggle color-coding.
- **Adjust cold and hot range thresholds** – define the gradient extremes.
- **Adjust comfortable range** – fine-tune what is considered a "comfortable" temperature.

Temperature units respect the game's `TemperatureDisplayMode` (Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin).

## Compatibility

- Built for RimWorld 1.5, 1.6
- Safe to add or remove mid-save
- No known mod conflicts
